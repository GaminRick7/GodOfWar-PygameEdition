### Code Used from other sources
- When starting to make my game, I was very new to using Pygame. As a result, I used the following resource to start my game. This resource constructed a good base for my game by helping me setup a window for my game, make the clock tick according to the fps, and to display the player. I mostly followed the first two parts of the tutorial series.

- I used the following resource to setup the horizontal and vertical tile-player collisions. It also helped me use  2D list to set up a tile map for my levels.
